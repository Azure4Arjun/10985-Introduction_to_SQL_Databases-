# Module 5: Performance
# Demonstration: Testing Index Performance

### Objectives

In this demonstration, you will see how to evaluate the performance impact of indexes.

### Preparation

1.	Ensure that the 10985C-MIA-DC and 10985C-MIA-SQL virtual machines are running and then log on to 10985C-MIA-SQL as **ADVENTUREWORKS\Student** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**. 

2.	Run **D:\Demofiles\Mod05\Setup.cmd** as an administrator to revert any changes.

### Demonstration Steps

1.  In the virtual machine, on the taskbar, click **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**.

2.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, in the **Server name** box, type **MIA-SQL**. In the **Authentication** box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then click **Connect**.

3.  On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, click **File**, browse to the **D:\\Demofiles\\Mod05\\Demo1.sql** file, and then click **Open**.

4.  To turn statistics on, highlight the code under **Step 1** and click **Execute**.

5.  To run a query with no indexes, highlight the code under **Step 2** and click **Execute**.

6. Click the **Messages** tab, and note the number of logical reads performed and the execution times.

7.  To create indexes, highlight the code under **Step 3** and click **Execute**.

8.  To run a query with indexes, highlight the code under **Step 4** and click **Execute**.

9. Click the **Messages** tab again, and compared the number of logical reads performed and the execution times against those for the previous query.

10.  To drop the indexes, highlight the code under **Step 5** and click **Execute**.

11.  Close SQL Server Management Studio without saving any changes.
