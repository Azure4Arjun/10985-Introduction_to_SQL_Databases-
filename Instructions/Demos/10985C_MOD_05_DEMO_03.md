# Module 5: Performance
# Demonstration: Locking and Blocking

### Objectives

In this demonstration, you will see the effects of locking and blocking.

### Preparation

1.	Ensure that the 10985C-MIA-DC and 10985C-MIA-SQL virtual machines are running and then log on to 10985C-MIA-SQL as **ADVENTUREWORKS\Student** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**. 

2.	Run **D:\Demofiles\Mod05\Setup.cmd** as an administrator to revert any changes.

### Demonstration Steps

1.  On the taskbar, click **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**.

2.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, in the **Server name** box, type **MIA-SQL**. Ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected in the **Authentication** box, and then click **Connect**.

3.  On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, click **File**, browse to the **D:\\Demofiles\\Mod05\\Demo3A.sql** file, and then click **Open**.

4.  On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, click **File**, browse to the **D:\\Demofiles\\Mod05\\Demo3B.sql** file, and then click **Open**.

5.  To start the first query, switch to the **Demo3A** tab, highlight the code under **Step 1** and click **Execute**. Do not wait for the query to complete (it won't).

6.  Switch to the **Demo3B** tab, highlight the code under **Step 2** and click **Execute**.

7.  Note that the query does not complete because it is being blocked.

8.  Switch to the **Demo3A** tab and, on the toolbar, click **Cancel Executing Query**.

9.  Wait until the cancellation has completed and switch to the **Demo3B** tab.

10. Notice that the query has now completed because the locks have been released.

11. Close SQL Server Management Studio without saving any changes.
