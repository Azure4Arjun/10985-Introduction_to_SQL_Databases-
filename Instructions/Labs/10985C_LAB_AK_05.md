## Exercise 1: Designing for Efficient Queries

#### Task 1: Plan Indexes for Querying

1.  Ensure that the 10985C-MIA-DC and 10985C-MIA-SQL virtual machines are both running, and then log on to 10985C-MIA-SQL as **ADVENTUREWORKS\\Student** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**.

2.  In the **D:\\Labfiles\\Lab05\\Starter** folder, double-click **DatabaseQueryDesign.docx**.

3.  Plan which clustered and nonclustered indexes you would add to this design, based on the design of the tables and the common queries.

4.  In the **D:\\Labfiles\\Lab05\\Solution** folder, double-click **PossibleIndexStrategy.docx**.

5.  Review and discuss any differences between your strategy and the proposed index strategy in the document.

#### Task 2: Plan Indexes for Concurrency

1.  If the database in the design has handled many transactions, in addition to the listed queries, note the effects this could have on the transactions.

2.  Note the effects this could have on the listed queries.

3.  Note the changes that you might make to the index strategy to support transactions.
